Hiring
 
Team
,
 
FORA,
 
New
 
York,
 
NY.
 
 
Dear
 
Hiring
 
Team,
 
 
 
I
 
am
 
eager
 
to
 
apply
 
for
 
the
 
AI
 
Innovator
 
position!
 
I
 
am
 
an
 
AI/ML
 
Engineer
 
with
 
3+
 
years
 
of
 
experience
 
in
 
the
 
development
 
and
 
testing
 
of
 
machine
 
learning,
 
generative
 
AI,
 
and
 
recommender
 
systems
 
â€”
 
and
 
always
 
on
 
the
 
lookout
 
for
 
new
 
methods
 
to
 
convert
 
new
 
concepts
 
into
 
prototypes
 
that
 
work.
 
 
At
 
Ulta
 
Beauty ,
 
I
 
developed
 
deep
 
learning-powered
 
recommender
 
systems
 
on
 
AWS
 
SageMaker ,
 
which
 
increased
 
click-through
 
rates
 
by
 
35%,
 
and
 
created
 
computer
 
vision
 
software
 
for
 
virtual
 
try-ons,
 
resulting
 
in
 
a
 
45%
 
increase
 
in
 
conversions.
 
I've
 
also
 
developed
 
LLM-based
 
projects
 
such
 
as
 
AI
 
chatbots
 
and
 
smarter
 
code
 
review
 
systems
 
via
 
LangChain,
 
Vertex
 
AI,
 
and
 
Hugging
 
Face.
 
So
 
I
 
feel
 
very
 
much
 
at
 
home
 
moving
 
quickly ,
 
iterating,
 
and
 
experimenting
 
with
 
new
 
concepts
 
with
 
limited
 
budgets.
 
 
I'm
 
passionate
 
about
 
Fora's
 
vision
 
of
 
merging
 
technology
 
with
 
human
 
imagination
 
to
 
empower
 
travel
 
founders.
 
I
 
would
 
love
 
the
 
opportunity
 
to
 
bring
 
my
 
technical
 
expertise
 
and
 
startup
 
mentality
 
towards
 
the
 
creation
 
and
 
validation
 
of
 
AI
 
features
 
that
 
can
 
further
 
the
 
travel
 
experience.
 
 
Looking
 
forward
 
to
 
an
 
opportunity .
 
Thank
 
you.
 
 
Best
 
Regards,
 
Saketh
 
Madabushi.
