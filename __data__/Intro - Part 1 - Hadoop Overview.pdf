Traditional Large-Scale Computation

= Traditionally, computation has been
processor-bound

— Relatively small amounts of data
— Lots of complex processing

= The early solution: bigger computers
- Faster processor, more memory
— But even this couldn’t keep up

Distributed Systems

= The better solution: more computers
— Distributed systems — use multiple machines
for a single job

“In pioneer days they used oxen for heavy
pulling, and when one ox couldn’t budge a log,
we didn’t try to grow a larger ox. We shouldn’t
be trying for bigger computers, but for more
systems of computers.”

Big Data Processing with Hadoop

= Hadoop introduced a radical new approach:
- Bring the program to the data rather than the data to the program

= Based on two key concepts
- Distribute data when the data is stored

— Run computation where the data resides A Hadoop Cluster

Data Ingest and Storage

= Hadoop typically ingests data from many
sources and in many formats

- Traditional data management systems, e.g.
databases

- Logs and other machine generated data
(event data) Data Sources _ Data Storage

— Imported files

Data Storage

= Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) egaep
— HDFS is the storage layer for Hadoop
— Provides inexpensive reliable storage for massive
amounts of data on industry-standard hardware eeosticeison ts) |
»

- Data is distributed when stored

- Covered later in this course

= Apache HBase: The Hadoop Database HDFS
-A NoSQL distributed database built on HDFS
— Scales to support very large amounts of data

and high throughput =

-A table can have thousands of columns y

- Covered in depth in Cloudera Training for Apache HBase

= Apache Pig builds on Hadoop to offer high-level data processing
- This is an alternative to writing low-level MapReduce code
— Pig is especially good at joining and transforming data

= The Pig interpreter runs on the client machine
- Turns Pig Latin scripts into MapReduce or Spark jobs
- Submits those jobs to a Hadoop cluster
- Covered in Cloudera Data Analyst Training

people = LOAD '/user/training/customers' AS (cust_id, name) ;
orders LOAD '/user/training/orders' AS (ord_id, cust_id, cost) ;
groups GROUP orders BY cust_id;

totals FOREACH groups GENERATE group, SUM(orders.cost) AS t;
result = JOIN totals BY group, people BY cust_id;
DUMP result;
