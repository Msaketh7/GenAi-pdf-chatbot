Designing
 
large-scale
 
recommendation
 
systems
 
using
 
deep

methods
 
like
 
Neural
 
Collaborative
 
Filtering
 
and
 
Wide

Deep
 
networks
 
on
 
AWS
 
SageMaker
.
 
This
 
involves
 
processing
 
over
 
50
 
million
 
customer
 
interactions
 
and
 
product
 
catalog
 
data
 
to
 
provide
 
personalized
 
beauty
 
product
 
suggestions.
 
As
 
a
 
result,
 
we
 
achieved
 
a
 
35%
 
improvement
 
in
 
click-through
 
rates.
 
●
 
Implementing
 
computer
 
vision
 
models
 
with
 
PyTorch
 
and
 
OpenCV
 
for
 
virtual
 
try-on
 
features.
 
This
 
includes
 
facial
 
landmark
 
detection,
 
skin
 
tone
 
analysis,
 
and
 
color
 
matching
 
algorithms.
 
We
 
saw
 
a
 
45%
 
increase
 
in
 
online
 
conversion
 
rates
 
and
 
a
 
20%
 
drop
 
in
 
product
 
returns.

models
 
with
 
ensemble
 
methods
 
like
 
LightGBM
 
and
 
CatBoost
,
 
along
 
with
 
RFM
 
analysis.
 
This
 
enables
 
targeted
 
marketing
 
campaigns
 
that
 
increase
 
customer
 
retention
 
by
 
30%.
 
●
 
Building
 
MLOps
 
infrastructure
 
with
 
Kubernetes
 
and
 
MLflow
 
for
 
automated
 
model
 
training,
 
validation,
 
and
 
deployment
 
pipelines.
 
This
 
reduced
 
the
 
model
 
deployment
 
time
 
from
 
weeks
 
to
 
hours.
 
●
 
Working
 
with

A/B
 
testing
 
frameworks
 
using
 
Optuna
 
for
 
hyperparameter
 
optimization
 
and
 
statistical
 
analysis.
 
This
